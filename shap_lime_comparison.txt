Comparison of local interpretations (SHAP vs LIME) for three selected instances:

Instance: high_conf_positive (test idx 428)
 - SHAP top contributors: worst texture (0.878), worst concave points (0.839), worst perimeter (0.809), worst area (0.711), area error (0.566)
 - LIME top contributors: worst texture <= 21.09 (0.195), worst concave points <= 0.06 (0.152), worst perimeter <= 83.72 (0.131), worst area <= 513.90 (0.129), area error <= 17.73 (0.114)

Instance: high_conf_negative (test idx 256)
 - SHAP top contributors: worst concave points (-1.181), worst perimeter (-1.005), worst texture (-0.794), worst area (-0.722), area error (-0.660)
 - LIME top contributors: worst concave points > 0.16 (-0.292), worst texture > 29.37 (-0.196), worst perimeter > 124.95 (-0.184), area error > 44.77 (-0.177), worst area > 1033.50 (-0.161)

Instance: low_confidence (test idx 541)
 - SHAP top contributors: worst texture (-1.168), worst perimeter (-0.933), mean concave points (0.699), mean smoothness (0.571), mean texture (-0.494)
 - LIME top contributors: worst texture > 29.37 (-0.194), 97.59 < worst perimeter <= 124.95 (-0.091), 17.73 < area error <= 24.25 (0.083), mean texture > 21.71 (-0.079), worst concavity > 0.39 (-0.066)


Overall, SHAP and LIME commonly highlight similar features (often tumor size/shape measures) but differ in how influence is distributed. SHAP computes Shapley values that provide additive, theoretically-grounded attributions and are consistent across instances; LIME fits a local linear surrogate and can place more weight on a few features depending on the local sampling. In high-confidence examples both methods usually agree on the primary drivers. In lower-confidence (borderline) cases LIME sometimes ascribes large weight to a single local feature, while SHAP displays influence distributed among interacting features—this difference arises from LIME's local linear fit versus SHAP's distributional approach. Practically, use SHAP for stable model audits and cohort-level insights, and LIME when you need a quick local linear explanation (but validate LIME's sensitivity to its sampling parameters).
