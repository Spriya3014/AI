Global Feature Importance (SHAP) - Report

Dataset: Breast Cancer (sklearn)
Model: XGBoost (saved in outputs)
Test accuracy: 0.9561

Top 5 features by mean(|SHAP|):
worst perimeter, worst concave points, worst texture, worst area, area error

Interpretation:
The SHAP analysis shows that the model relies primarily on the following features (top-5): worst perimeter, worst concave points, worst texture, worst area, area error.
These features correspond to tumor size and shape measurements. Higher values of the top size-related features generally increase the model's predicted probability for the positive class (malignant),
while lower values push predictions toward the negative class (benign). Dependence plots can be inspected to check for monotonicity and interactions. See shap_feature_importance.csv for precise values.
